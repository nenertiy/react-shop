# [React Shop - Built with Vite, Zustand, and TanStack Query](https://react-shop-swart-five.vercel.app)

This is a feature-rich online store built with **React** and powered by **Vite** for fast and efficient development. The app integrates with an **Open API** to fetch product data dynamically. For state management, we use **Zustand**, and for handling server-side data fetching and caching, **TanStack Query** (React Query) is implemented, making this app scalable and performant.

## Features:
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server for lightning-fast hot reloading and bundling.
- **React**: Component-based architecture for a smooth and dynamic user interface.
- **Zustand**: Lightweight and easy-to-use state management for handling global states like shopping cart and user data.
- **TanStack Query (React Query)**: Manages asynchronous server-side data fetching, caching, and synchronization with ease.
- **Open API**: Fetches real-time product data from an external API.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout that adapts to various screen sizes.

- **Vite** - Development and build tool
