# React Shop - Built with Vite, Zustand, and TanStack Query

This is a feature-rich online store built with **React** and powered by **Vite** for fast and efficient development. The app integrates with an **Open API** to fetch product data dynamically. For state management, we use **Zustand**, and for handling server-side data fetching and caching, **TanStack Query** (React Query) is implemented, making this app scalable and performant.

## Features:
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server for lightning-fast hot reloading and bundling.
- **React**: Component-based architecture for a smooth and dynamic user interface.
- **Zustand**: Lightweight and easy-to-use state management for handling global states like shopping cart and user data.
- **TanStack Query (React Query)**: Manages asynchronous server-side data fetching, caching, and synchronization with ease.
- **Open API**: Fetches real-time product data from an external API.

## Tech Stack:
- **Vite** - Development and build tool
- **React** - UI framework
- **Zustand** - Global state management
- **TanStack Query** - Server-side data fetching and caching
- **CSS/Styled Components** - For styling components
